# Pokedex_app
JS basics using the power of Pokemon! 

Built from scratch, using vanilla JS to begin with and moving into jQuery and bootstrap once I had an understanding of the JavaScript fundamentals. 

This simple app pulls data from a pokemon api, parses the data and then creates a series of buttons for each of the 150 pokemon. When clicked, these buttons open a modal with further pokemon infomation and images of the mons.
